            <p>
                <b>Description:</b>"HEROEAR," a groundbreaking hearing aid device set to redefine the hearing aid industry. HEROEAR is truly unique in the market. While several foreign companies and even India produce hearing aid devices, there has been a glaring gap in Pakistan, with no local company dedicated to assisting hearing-impaired individuals. This is a significant unmet need, and it's what motivates us to serve our country in this sector.
            </p>
            <img src="main.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
            <p>
                HEROEAR isn't just a concept; it's a reality. We've already tested and deployed our devices, making a tangible impact. Currently, there are five individuals in Peshawar, including Yousuf, the 14-year-old with congenital hearing loss, who are experiencing the transformative effects of HEROEAR.
            </p>
            <img src="buttons.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
            <p>
                Their stories inspire us daily, and we're committed to expanding our reach to help even more people in Pakistan and beyond. Our innovation is driven by a genuine desire to make a difference in the lives of those with hearing impairments, like Yousuf, and bridge the gap in accessible hearing care solutions.

                <b>Description:</b>This is a Electric Bike Developed by Me and My Team. My team consists of 5 people who are students of Mechtronics Egineering in UET Peshawar. We made this bike an year ago for the ease of people as the petrol prices get increase after some time and got a high rate now. Also, by keeping in view our environment as it is engine less and will not produce any harmfull radiations for the living beings.
